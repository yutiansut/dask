Comparison to Spark
===================

`Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_ is a popular distributed computing
tool for tabular datasets that is growing to become a dominant name in Big Data
analysis today.  Dask has several elements that appear to intersect this space
and we are often asked, "How does Dask compare with Spark?"

Answering such comparison questions in an unbiased and informed way is hard,
particularly when the differences can be somewhat technical.  This document
tries to do this; we welcome any corrections.

Summary
-------

Generally Dask is smaller and lighter weight than Spark.  This means that it
has fewer features and, instead, is intended to be used in conjunction with other
libraries, particularly those in the numeric Python ecosystem.  It couples with
other libraries like Pandas or Scikit-Learn to achieve high-level
functionality.

- Language
    - Spark is written in Scala with some support for Python and R.  It
      interoperates well with other JVM code.
    - Dask is written in Python and only really supports Python.  It
      interoperates well with C/C++/Fortran/LLVM or other natively compiled
      code linked through Python.
- Ecosystem
    - Spark is an all-in-one project that has inspired its own ecosystem.  It
      integrates well with many other Apache projects.
    - Dask is a component of the larger Python ecosystem.  It couples with and
      enhances other libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
- Age and Trust
    - Spark is older (since 2010) and has become a dominant and
      well-trusted tool in the Big Data enterprise world.
    - Dask is younger (since 2014) and is an extension of the
      well trusted NumPy/Pandas/Scikit-learn/Jupyter stack.
- Scope
    - Spark is more focused on traditional business intelligence
      operations like SQL and lightweight machine learning.
    - Dask is applied more generally both to business intelligence
      applications, as well as a number of scientific and custom situations.
- Internal Design
    - Spark's internal model is higher level, providing good high level
      optimizations on uniformly applied computations, but lacking flexibility
      for more complex algorithms or ad-hoc systems.  It is fundamentally an
      extension of the Map-Shuffle-Reduce paradigm.
    - Dask's internal model is lower level, and so lacks high level
      optimizations, but is able to implement more sophisticated algorithms and
      build more complex bespoke systems.  It is fundamentally based on generic
      task scheduling.
- Scale
    - Spark scales from a single node to thousand-node clusters.
    - Dask scales from a single node to thousand-node clusters.
- APIs
    - DataFrames
        - Spark DataFrame has its own API and memory model.  It also
          implements a large subset of the SQL language.  Spark includes a
          high-level query optimizer for complex queries.
        - Dask DataFrame reuses the Pandas API and memory model.  It implements
          neither SQL nor a query optimizer.  It is able to do random access,
          efficient time series operations, and other Pandas-style indexed
          operations.
    - Machine Learning
        - Spark MLLib is a cohesive project with support for common operations
          that are easy to implement with Spark's Map-Shuffle-Reduce style
          system.  People considering MLLib might also want to consider *other*
          JVM-based machine learning libraries like H2O, which may have better
          performance.
        - Dask relies on and interoperates with existing libraries like
          Scikit-Learn and XGBoost.  These can be more familiar or higher
          performance, but generally results in a less-cohesive whole.  See the
          `dask-ml`_ project for integrations.
    - Arrays
        - Spark does not include support for multi-dimensional arrays natively
          (this would be challenging given their computation model), although
          some support for two-dimensional matrices may be found in MLLib.
          People may also want to look at the `Thunder
          <https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder>`_ project, which
          combines Apache Spark with NumPy arrays.
        - Dask fully supports the NumPy model for :doc:`scalable multi-dimensional
          arrays <array>`.
    - Streaming
        - Spark's support for streaming data is first-class and integrates well
          into their other APIs.  It follows a mini-batch approach.  This
          provides decent performance on large uniform streaming operations.
        - Dask provides a :doc:`real-time futures interface <futures>` that is
          lower-level than Spark streaming.  This enables more creative and
          complex use-cases, but requires more work than Spark streaming.
    - Graphs / complex networks
        - Spark provides GraphX, a library for graph processing.
        - Dask provides no such library.
    - Custom parallelism
        - Spark generally expects users to compose computations out of their
          high-level primitives (map, reduce, groupby, join, ...).  It is also
          possible to extend Spark through subclassing RDDs, although this is
          rarely done.
        - Dask allows you to specify arbitrary task graphs for more complex and
          custom systems that are not part of the standard set of collections.

Reasons you might choose Spark
------------------------------

-  You prefer Scala or the SQL language
-  You have mostly JVM infrastructure and legacy systems
-  You want an established and trusted solution for business
-  You are mostly doing business analytics with some lightweight machine learning
-  You want an all-in-one solution


Reasons you might choose Dask
-----------------------------

-  You prefer Python or native code, or have large legacy code bases that you
   do not want to entirely rewrite
-  Your use case is complex or does not cleanly fit the Spark computing model
-  You want a lighter-weight transition from local computing to cluster
   computing
-  You want to interoperate with other technologies and don't mind installing
   multiple packages


Developer-Facing Differences
----------------------------

Graph Granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Spark and Dask represent computations with directed acyclic graphs.  These
graphs however represent computations at very different granularities.

One operation on a Spark RDD might add a node like ``Map`` and ``Filter`` to
the graph.  These are high-level operations that convey meaning and will
eventually be turned into many little tasks to execute on individual workers.
This many-little-tasks state is only available internally to the Spark
scheduler.

Dask graphs skip this high-level representation and go directly to the
many-little-tasks stage.  As such, one ``map`` operation on a Dask collection
will immediately generate and add possibly thousands of tiny tasks to the Dask
graph.

This difference in the scale of the underlying graph has implications on the
kinds of analysis and optimizations one can do and also on the generality that
one exposes to users.  Dask is unable to perform some optimizations that Spark
can because Dask schedulers do not have a top-down picture of the computation
they were asked to perform.  However, Dask is able to easily represent far more
`complex algorithms`_ and expose the creation of these algorithms to normal users.


Conclusion
----------

Spark is mature and all-inclusive.  If you want a single project that does
everything and you're already on Big Data hardware, then Spark is a safe bet,
especially if your use cases are typical ETL + SQL and you're already using
Scala.

Dask is lighter weight and is easier to integrate into existing code and hardware.
If your problems vary beyond typical ETL + SQL and you want to add flexible
parallelism to existing solutions, then Dask may be a good fit, especially if
you are already using Python and associated libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

If you are looking to manage a terabyte or less of tabular CSV or JSON data,
then you should forget both Spark and Dask and use Postgres_ or MongoDB_.
