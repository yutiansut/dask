Thank you for reporting an issue.

Please read the following guidelines to ensure that your issue is handled
properly.  If you have a ...

1.  **General Question**: like *"How do I filter a dask.dataframe?"* then
    please consider asking the question on StackOverflow using the #Dask tag.

    Please do not ask a question in both locations.

    If you think that you have run into a bug or have an unexplained exception
    then please prefer to file a bug report here.

2.  **Bug report:** then please include a self-contained copy-pastable
    example that generates the issue if possible.  Please be concise with code
    posted.  See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:

    -  [Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
    -  [Craft Minimal Bug Reports](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports)

    Bug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose,
    and so are often handled much more quickly.

3.  **Question about a sub-project:** like the distributed scheduler,
    dask-kubernetes, s3fs, fastparquet, etc.  then please consider submitting a
    report to that issue tracker instead.  A list of repositories can be
    found at [github.com/dask](https://github.com/dask)

4.  **Feature Request:** then please do a quick search of existing issues to
    make sure that this has not been asked before.

We know that asking good questions takes effort, and we appreciate your time.
Thank you again.
